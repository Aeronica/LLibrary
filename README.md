==========

The lightweight Minecraft modding library.

Quickstart
==========
To use this library, all you have to do is adding it as dependency in the Gradle build script. However, since we haven't released 1.0.0 yet, there is no repo yet.

Compiling from source
==========
1. Make sure you've got the Java Development Kit version 8 or higher installed.
2. If you have Gradle installed, simply run 'gradle build'. If you DO NOT have Gradle installed, run 'gradlew.bat build' on windows systems, or './gradlew build' on OS X and Linux systems.
